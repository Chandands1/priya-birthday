                    My dear Priya, I can’t begin to express just how much you mean to me. From the very first day we met, I knew you were special. Our friendship has grown into something deep and meaningful, filled with laughter, shared secrets, and endless memories. You are not just a friend; you are family, a confidant, and my everything.
                </p>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                    Every moment spent with you has been a gift – from the flirty banter that makes me smile to the quiet, caring moments that bring me comfort. I cherish every bit of our journey together and am so grateful to have you by my side.
                </p>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                    So here's to many more years of friendship, fun, and perhaps a little more of that playful flirting that keeps our bond strong. Happy Birthday, my dearest Priya! May all your dreams come true and may we continue to create memories that last a lifetime.
                </p>
